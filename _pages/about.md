I hold a Bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Science and Technology (USTB) and I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), advised by Yu Hu. My research focuses on the field of computer science, with a particular emphasis on developing algorithms to solve problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am passionate about exploring new approaches to these problems and have been fortunate enough to work on several exciting projects during my time at ICT. I am excited to continue my research in this field and to contribute to the advancement of computer science and technology.

My research interests include semantic segmentation and neural architecture search. With regards to semantic segmentation, I am interested in developing more accurate and efficient algorithms for image and video analysis. Specifically, I focus on designing effective neural networks to better understand the semantic meaning of visual data.

Regarding neural architecture search, I am working on developing automated methods to design and optimize neural network architectures. This involves exploring different network topologies and architectures to find the optimal solution for a given task. I believe that this research will have significant impact on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I am excited to be a part of this exciting field.
